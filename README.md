In this tutorial, you'll learn how to setup environment for Python to execute or run a Python program.
How to Run or Execute a Python Program ?

To execute a Python program, generally you've two options, as given below:

    Execute Python program directly using Python IDLE
    Execute Python program using any Python IDE like PyCharm

Note - In this series of Python tutorial, all the programs are created under and executed using PyCharm IDE.

Now the question is, why to use PyCharm ?. Here are the list of some answers, that may satisfy this question:

    It is free
    It is lightweight
    Best suited for Python
    Offers much more functionality for Python programming
    It makes development easier and productive
    Offers many built-in developer tools
    And the most important feature is, it provides intelligent coding assistance.


Environment Setup using Python IDLE

In both the cases, that is, executing Python codes using directly Python IDLE or using PyCharm IDE, Python software need to be installed on your PC. That is, Python software is necessary to be available in your PC to execute any Python code either using directly the IDLE, or using any virtual IDE like PyCharm, Eclipse, PyDev, or Spyder etc.

Therefore, follow all the steps given below one by one, to install and setup Python IDLE so that you becomes able to run or execute your Python code.
Python IDLE Setup - Step No.1

Since, right now the latest Python version is 3.9.6. Therefore I've downloaded this development software from Internet. But I recommend you to download the very latest version of the Python from Internet.

That is, download latest Python from Internet.
Note - Download only from the official website "python.org".

Attention - Don't visit any unknown website.

That is, open the website python.org. Here is the snapshot of the opened website:

As indicated above, click on the Download button from main navigation to open the download page that looks like:

As again indicated above, click on the Download Python 3.9.6 (this version gets changed at the time when you visit, if latest version arrives). The download gets started after clicking on this button. The size may be around 20-30 MB

Now install the software Python in your system. After installation, follow the steps given below
Python IDLE Setup - Step No.2

If you've Windows 7, then go to Start -> All Programs -> Python 3.9 -> IDLE (Python 3.9 - 64 bit). If you've 32-bit Windows, then in place of 64-bit, you'll see 32-bit

If you've Windows 10 (32-bit or 64-bit), then go to Start -> Python 3.9 -> IDLE (Python 3.9 64-bit). Whatever your system is say Linux, Apple Mac etc. do follow the similar steps to open the Python IDLE. Here is the snapshot:

And here is the snapshot of the Windows IDLE Shell 3.9.6. The windows opened after clicking on IDLE (Python 3.9 64-bit) as told above:

Now let's create and execute a Python program using this Python Shell directly. Follow the next step.
Python IDLE Setup - Step No.3

As the Python Shell windows opened, therefore navigate to or click on FILE -> NEW FILE as shown in the snapshot given below:

A new windows opened after navigating as told above. Now type the following code in that window:

print("Hey!, Welcome to cyber_jollof 30 days of codding")
