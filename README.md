How to Run or Execute a Python Program ?

To execute a Python program, generally you've two options, as given below:

    Execute Python program directly using Python IDLE
    Execute Python program using any Python IDE like PyCharm

Note - In this series of Python tutorial, all the programs are created under and executed using PyCharm IDE.

Now the question is, why to use PyCharm ?. Here are the list of some answers, that may satisfy this question:

    It is free
    It is lightweight
    Best suited for Python
    Offers much more functionality for Python programming
    It makes development easier and productive
    Offers many built-in developer tools
    And the most important feature is, it provides intelligent coding assistance.


Environment Setup using Python IDLE

In both the cases, that is, executing Python codes using directly Python IDLE or using PyCharm IDE, Python software need to be installed on your PC. That is, Python software is necessary to be available in your PC to execute any Python code either using directly the IDLE, or using any virtual IDE like PyCharm, Eclipse, PyDev, or Spyder etc.

Therefore, follow all the steps given below one by one, to install and setup Python IDLE so that you becomes able to run or execute your Python code.
Python IDLE Setup - Step No.1

Since, right now the latest Python version is 3.9.6. Therefore I've downloaded this development software from Internet. But I recommend you to download the very latest version of the Python from Internet.

That is, download latest Python from Internet.
Note - Download only from the official website "python.org".

Attention - Don't visit any unknown website.
